Launch Sites Locations Analysis with Folium
The launch success rate may depend on many factors such as payload mass, orbit type, and so on. It may also depend on the location and proximities of a launch site, i.e., the initial position of rocket trajectories. 
Finding an optimal location for building a launch site certainly involves many factors and we could discover some of the factors by analyzing the existing launch site locations.

This lab contains the following tasks:
TASK 1: Mark all launch sites on a map
TASK 2: Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
